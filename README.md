# MyToken
This program is a simple Token program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of a Token in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to get familiar with creating tokens.
# Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two function for Minting and Burning token. There are three state variables to let you know about token and its state.
# Getting started
# Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., firstToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.10" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile firstToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "firstToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
 Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mintToken burnToken function. Finally, click on the totalSupply Variable to get total value.
