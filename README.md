hi i am dhruv 
this beginner (Token)
firstly i created a string variable ,make it public that named dhruv.same goes on abbreviation,and totalsupply(uint thats public)
we will give it zero(0).
contract have a mapping of addresses to balances.,
and for mint function that has two parameters  address and value.,(the function that increase the total supply by that number and increases the balance by account)
this always a positive . and the negetive one is burn function(its only work when the balance account is greater than or equal to the account.
then compiled it .
{ i  used deafult one acc that has to be same as burn and mint and total balance so then you can see it how it works the function that transacted on specific value you choosed .}
